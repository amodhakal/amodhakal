# Amodh Dhakal

I build production software across the stack from real-time web applications to low-level graphics systems. My work focuses on solving concrete user problems with thoughtful technical architecture and performance-conscious implementation.

### ✅ [OpenTodoist](https://opentodoist.vercel.app)

Bulk task creation for Todoist via AI extraction. Converts unstructured text into structured tasks with intelligent priority and date parsing.

**Key technical work:**
- OAuth 2.0 implementation with Todoist API
- Application-layer rate limiting with quota tracking
- Structured output extraction from LLM responses

**Stack:** Next.js 15, PostgreSQL, Drizzle ORM, Gemini 2.0

### 🎮 [Linterra](https://github.com/amodhakal/linterra)

Voxel rendering engine exploring graphics systems fundamentals: infinite terrain generation, GPU-efficient meshing, real-time optimization.

**Performance:** 54→120 fps (2.2x), 1.6 GB→0.3 MB (99.8% reduction) via greedy meshing and frustum culling

**Key technical work:**
- Chunk-based world management with spatial hashing
- Greedy meshing algorithm for geometry reduction
- Static GPU buffer strategy with VAO/VBO per chunk

**Stack:** C++23, OpenGL 3.3+, GLFW, GLM
