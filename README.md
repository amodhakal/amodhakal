# Amodh Dhakal

I build production software across the stack from real-time web applications to low-level graphics systems. My work focuses on solving concrete user problems with thoughtful technical architecture and performance-conscious implementation.

Full-stack web development (JavaScript/TypeScript ecosystems), systems programming (C++), computer graphics. Comfortable across the entire stack like database design, API architecture, real-time client state, GPU optimization.
